Green light, Seven Eleven,
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes.
You don't smoke, don't even want to.
Hey now, check your change.
Dressed up like a car crash
Your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down.
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive.
Oh, is that what it is?
